As a starting point we implemnt a naive version is also know as Quick-Find where in worst case we can have $O(N^{2})$ runtime. Afterwards, we optimize it by adding a weighting to reduce the unnecessary risk of having subgraphs with high depth and also using path reduction. Beneficial about it that we can reduce the worst case scenario to $O(N+M \\times ln^{*}(N))$.\n",

    "# Monte Carlo Simulation for Percolation\n",
    "------\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Percolation theory studies how connectivity emerges in random networks. This simulation implements site percolation on a 2D square using Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "The simulation works by:\n",
    "1. Starting with an empty grid where all nodes are inactive\n",
    "2. Randomly opening nodes one by one\n",
    "3. Using a Union-Find data structure to efficiently track connected clusters\n",
    "4. Determining the critical threshold when a connected path forms from top to bottom\n",
    "5. Repeating this process multiple times to obtain statistical estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Percolation Threshold\n",
    "The percolation threshold is the ratio (active to inactive nodes) at which a connected path appears. In the implementation this is measured as the ratio of active nodes to total nodes at the moment of percolation. Increasing the grid size leads to a sharper transistion and ultimately for an infinite 2D square, the theoretical threshold is approximately 0.593. \n",
    "\n",
    "![percolation_probabilities](images/union_find/percolation_probabilities.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "This code uses a weighted quick-union algorithm with path compression for efficient cluster identification. Virtual top and bottom nodes are used to simplify the detection of a percolating path."
